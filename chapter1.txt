I live in japan as student for 3 years. As in title, the story was began when I decided to have **arubaito** or part time job. The place of my part time job is Fish Market. 

The Fish Market in Japan, is the most famous place in each perfectural besides the castle, shopping and red districts. Fish is everything in Japan.

So, working part time is new for me, but I planned. I planned when one year before go Japan. Just same time when I answer my questions:"What will I do after graduates?". 

I often read a blog or even hear from my friends about their relatives that pursuit the PhD in overseas. Also hear the story that their relatives tried to survive with working part time. At moment, I was curious with what feeling, what experience to having this. I just same with other undergrat which living in developing country, never cross in mind for having job or degree overseas, moreover part time job for survival.

Before I go to Japan,  while being undergraduate students, I have -not so bad project which is building wifi infrastructure on school, campus or cafe. At that time I have 3-4 employee. But this bussiness not quite long, since I was not able find what my passion is. Then I join my friends software house company. Shortly is, I never experience to be true employee, work at life support sector, low wage and daily schedule. 


This book actually note for my self when I will being the boss. But, not only lesson about how services the employee, but other thing occur that worth it to take lesson. My wife encourage me to write this lesson being note or book. 

This book save your time with understanding my experience being employee. My experiences may represent your employee feeling.
